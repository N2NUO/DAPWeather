There are some enhancements planned for this script:
- error trapping in case core server can't be connected
- message via pager in case core server is disconnected
- include more details in the message (longer pager text needed)
- logging of result code returned by core
- limited number of resend attempts in case result code is negative
- warning via pager in case no weather data could be pulled
